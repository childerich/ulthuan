# Ulthuan - WIP

## How this plays

This is a set  of rules for an epic digital warhammer multiplayer campaign. The battles are played in Total War Warhammer II, but everything else takes place outside the computer game. It’s inspired by the blood in the badlands campaign for the tabletop game, but played 100% online.

***What do you need?***
- Some friends. Either so close you are absolutely sure your friendship will survive this, or someone you might be willing to sacrifice for a good backstab... We played with 6, but some more should also work if you adapt the rules accordingly.
- Time, something like 3-6 months depending on how committed you are. A phase of lookdown during a global pandemic has proven to be fitting.
- The computer game Warhammer tw2 for every player. We didn’t go for wh tw3 due to the (current) lack of playable fractions. 
- Ways of communicating: a signal or whatsapp messenger group is sufficient 
- A shared shared Google doc presentation for keeping track of everything: the map, diplomacy, army setups etc - an example is here: TODO
- a way of randomizing things, we went with a fancy custom dicerolling bot for our signal group but there are also [simple free webistes](https://www.rolldicewithfriends.com/) available for that task.

## Introduction
*Father NUrgle has released his masterpiece on the Elves of Ulthuan: The most infectous of diseases has spread like wildfire through the island and left whole cities and provinces deserted. The weakened elves struggle to keep a few strongholds, but most of the land is deserted. Treasure Hunters, Adventurers and settlers are flocking to the harbours of the old world; to catch a ship to the land of unlimited riches and opprtunities. "Humanitiarian Expeditions" and worse are mustered. Noone seems to be bothered by the fact that the plague is still around...*

## Overview
Like in any decent strategy game, there is a strategic map where you move your armies, build cities and infrastructure etc. with a limited amount of Action Points (AP). When armies end their turn on the same province, a battle is fought in Warhammer Total War and the winner usually gets the province. For winning battles and various other things you get victory points (VP). Depending on the victory point progress various special events are triggered. And there still is the plague, that might get out of control if you don't collectivly establish some basic hygiene rules...

## The Map
You find a map of Ulthuan separated in 36 provinces in the maps folder. It's made by hand with more love than skill, so feel free to modify or make up your own if you prefer. If you are lazy copy this map as the first page of our google doc-presentation, steal some coloured icons (armies, cities, control etc.) from the internet that can be copied&pasted and moved around and you are ready to go.

## Turn Sequence
Every turn represents a month in Ulthuan. We tried to play one turn every real time week, with a set appointment of a game night every tuesday when all the battles are fought and the bookkeeping for the next turn is done - but use whatever fits for your group. Every Turn consists of the following steps:

1. ***Plague of NUrgle***: Roll a D3 and move the [Plague Bar](#plague) down by the amount, to a minimum of -10. Then increase it by one for every action point the players have invested into hygiene measures in the previous turn. For every hygiene measure, the player can now declare himself immune against a single effect of the plague of Nurgle for this turn. Then activate all the effects of the plague, starting at 0 and ending at the effect with the current marker
2. ***Production***: All ,ines, harbours and shrines of all players produce now. Owners of sanctuaries have to decide if they produce AP or VP. Then check if all the players can still pay the upkeep of their armies and roll on the ["Where is our Pay??"](#pay) table if not.
3. ***Random Events***: In current Turn order, roll a D66 for every player and evaluate the [Random Event](#events)
4. ***Trade***: Prisoners of war can be exchanged, freed or executed, Magic Items traded. If you want to relocate your capital, now is the time.
5. ***Action Phase***: Every player starts with 3 AP (Action Points) by default. The 1st player in the Turn order uses all his or her AP, then the 2nd etc. The Turn order will stay the same for most of the campaign, but the starting player rotates every turn, meaning that who went 1st goes last next turn, who went 2nd goes 1st etc. 
6. ***Battles***: All battles are preferably fought on the game night together. If you can't make it, you can always nominate another player as replacement or let the AI fight (difficulty hard)

## Victory Points and special Events
*You should define for yourself what VP represent for your faction, what are you actually looking for in Ulthuan? Treasure, Elven artifacts, warpstone, shimmering garbage - there is enough for everyone*
Whenever the first player reaches a specific amount of VP, a special event is triggered at the end of the turn:
- 6 VP: Lothern
- 13 VP: Shrine of Khaine
- 21 VP: Vaults Anvil
- 30 VP Gaean Vale
- 40 VP: Isle of the dead / the Final battle

## Actions
Per default, every player has 3 AP (Action Points) per Turn. 1AP can be spent for:
- ***Move***: Move one of your armies or the army of a friendly (relations >0) creep nation. Movement normally goes for up to 3 fields.
- ***Recruit***: Create a new army on a field you control. If you would have too many armies afterwards, you have to disband one
- ***Build***: Once per army and turn: if you own the field you are standing on, and there is no unfriendly army: either create a new building if the field is empty, or upgrade the existing building.
- ***Demolish***: Remove or downgrade the building on an own field with an own army
- ***Hygiene Measures***: Improve the Plague Bar by 1 next turn, buy temporal immunity against one plague effect
- ***Poison a well***: Lower the Plague Bar by 1 next turn
- ***Diplomacy***: Either improve your own relation with a creep nation of your choice by 1 (and gift them gold if you like to) or lower the relations of another player with a creep nation of your choice by 1

## The Final Battle: Isle of the Dead {special5}
The battle of the isle of the dead is the final of the campaign and determines the glorious winner. It’s triggered at the end of the turn in which any player reaches or exceeds 40VP. Alternatively, if you want to or have to end the campaign early, just fight it at any point in the campaign - if all players agree of course. 
### Fluff
insert fluff here
### Mode of play
It happens in the following steps:
1. *Muster your forces*: all players pick their favourite army. Remaining gold and magic items can be traded and invested for the last time.
2. Rank all players by their current VP decending.
3. Now play a normal pitched battle between the last and the second last player. Calculate the difference in VP between the two players. For every point difference, roll a D6 and multiply the result by 100 - the higher ranking player can now buy temporary reinforcements using that many gold. The reinforcements disappear after the battle. Note that the 75% rule still applies.
4. If the lower ranking player wins the battle, ***the VP of the two players are switched***. The campaign is now over for the loosing player. 
5. The winner now plays a battle against the next player in the ranking exactly as desribed at (3) - potentially using their newly achieved VP when the strength difference of the higher ranking player is calculated.
6. Repeat 3&4 until every player has played at least one battle
7. The player with the most VP now is in control of the maelstorm and wins the campaign.
