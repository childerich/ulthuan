# Ulthuan

## How this plays

This is a set  of rules for a epic digital warhammer multiplayer campaign. The battles are played in TW2 warhammer, but everything else takes place outside the computer game. It’s inspired by the blood in the badlands campaign for the tabletop game, but played 100% online.
What you do you need:
- Some friends. Either so close you are absolutely sure your friendship will survive this or someone you might be willing to sacrifice for a good backstab... We played with 6, but some more should also work if you adapt the rules accordingly
- Time, something like 3-6 month depending on how committed you are. A phase of lookdown during a global pandemic has proven to be fitting.
- The computer game Warhammer tw2 for every player, we didn’t go for wh3 due to the lack of playable fractions. 
- Ways of communicating: a signal or whatsapp  messenger group is sufficient 
- A shared shared Google doc presentation for keeping track of everything: the map, diplomacy, army setups etc - an example is here:
- a way of randomizing things, we went with a fancy custom dicerolling bot for our signal group but there are also [simple free webistes](https://www.rolldicewithfriends.com/) available for that task.

## Introduction
*Father NUrgle has released his masterpiece on the Elves of Ulthuan: The most infectous of Diseases has spread like wildfire through the island and left whole cities and provinces deserted. The weakened elves struggle to keep a few strongholds, but most of the land is deserted. Treasure Hunters, "Humanitiarian Expeditions" and settlers are flocking to the harbours of the old world; to catch a ship to the land of unlimited riches and opprtunities. Noone seems to be bothered by the plague...*

## Overview
Like in any decent strategy game, there is a strategic map where you move your armies, build cities and infrastructure etc. with a limited amount of Action Points (AP). When armies end their turn on the same province, a battle is fought in Warhammer Total War and the winner usually gets the province. For winning battles and various other things you get victory points (VP). Depending on the victory point progress various special events are triggered. And there still is the plague, that might get out of control if you don't collectivly establish some basic hygiene rules...

## The Map
You find a map of Ulthuan separated in 36 provinces in the maps folder. It's made by hand with a lot of love but unfortunately not a lot of skill, so feel free to modify or make up your own if you prefer. We used this map as the first page of our google doc-presantation, stole some coloured icons (armies, cities, control etc.) from the internet that could be copied&pasted and moved around and we where ready to go.

## Turn Sequence
Every turn represents a month in Ulthuan. We tried to play one turn every real time week, with a set appointment of a game night every tuesday when all the battles are fought and the bookkeeping for the next turn is done - but use whatever fits for your group.s Every Turn consists of the following steps:

1. ***Plague of NUrgle***: Roll a D3 and move the [Plague Bar](#plague) down by the amount, to a minimum of -10. Then increase it by one for every action point the players have invested into hygiene measures in the previous turn. For every hygiene measure, the player can now declare himself immune against a single effect of the plague of Nurgle for this turn. Then Activate all the effects of the plague, starting at 0 and ending at the effect with the current marker
2. ***Production***: All Mines, Harbours and Shrines of all players produce now. Owners of sanctuaries have to decide if they produce AP or VP now. Then check if all the players can still pay the upkeep of their armies and roll on the ["Where is our Pay??"](#pay) table if not.
3. ***Random Events***: In current Turn order, roll a D66 for every player and evaluate the [Random Event](#events)
4. ***Trade***: Prisoners of war can be exchanged, freed or executed, Magic Items traded. If you want to relocate your capital, now is the time.
5. ***Action Phase***: Every player starts with 3 AP (Action Points) by default. The 1st player in the Turn order uses all his or her AP, then the 2nd etc. s
6. ***Battles***:
